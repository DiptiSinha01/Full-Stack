# React Routing & Profile Dashboard Experiments

This repository contains two frontend experiments developed using **React.js**.  
The experiments focus on understanding **client-side routing**, **component-based UI development**, and **dashboard-style layouts**.

## 🔹 Experiment 1: React Routing (Home / About / Contact)

### 📌 Description
This experiment demonstrates **basic client-side routing** using `react-router-dom`.  
Navigation between pages happens without refreshing the browser, following the **Single Page Application (SPA)** approach.

### 📄 Pages Implemented
- Home Page  
- About Page  
- Contact Page  

Each page is rendered dynamically based on the URL path.

### 🛠 Concepts Used
- React Router (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`)
- Single Page Application (SPA)
- Component-based architecture
- URL-based navigation
